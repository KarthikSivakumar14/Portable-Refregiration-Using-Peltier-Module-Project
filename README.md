# Portable-Refregirator-Using-Peltier-Moule-Project
This project is an advanced portable refrigeration system that combines Peltier modules
with hot and cold hybrid technology, catering to diverse cooling needs across various
applications. By integrating both technologies, the system achieves superior cooling
efficiency and optimized thermal management. Peltier modules utilize the Peltier effect to
transfer heat upon applying an electric current, delivering effective cooling capabilities. Complemented by hot and cold hybrid technology, which further enhances cooling
efficiency through separate cooling and heating mechanisms, maximizing energy
utilization.
